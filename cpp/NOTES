Testing with gdb
================
In test.cpp, I have a couple blocks that build a random matrix.  I usually want to run this a gazillion times to see if it breaks things.  If it breaks things bad enough, I'll get a seg fault or something.  I can make gdb run test a bunch by doing the following:

$ gdb test
(gdb) break exit
(gdb) commands
(gdb) run
(gdb) exit
(gdb) run

This will put a breakpoint at the exit statement of test and run the code a bunch or until it segfaults.

Use valgrind!
